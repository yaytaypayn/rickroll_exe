# rickroll_exe
an exe file that opens rick stleys never gonna give you up after 10 minutes

this here exe when opened relies dorment for ten minutes in which it will open the vide

i am working on another iteration of this exe which is written in py and is presented in py form in the file tagged below
the new itteration that i am working on will use pynput to allow me to lock the video on fullscreen and higher the volume
_ ps i also plan on rendering the keyboard useless of any form of input and thhings like that making the exe more powerfull


i will also be working on a acomponyng malduino (badusb) script for it to install and open the exe and disable the windows defender
